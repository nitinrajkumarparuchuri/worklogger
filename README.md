Working in remote makes the boundaries of working hours blurred
With the kind of feed back that I receive at times push me to work more
I dont have a track of time that I work for

With this I start the timer soon after I start working and stop it
When the timer reaches 8hrs in a day... I will pause and resume the next day
At least that is the objective
I will try to analyze the trends in my working hours etc
Will update it how this effected me
